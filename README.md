# PySnake 🐍🍏
This is a game I designed with 3 friends that ressembles that is heavily insipired by the classic Snake game prevalent during the Nokia phone era 

Remember to install Pygame properly on the IDE you're currently using in order for the code to run properly. 
Don't mind the dark brackground. It's not like the green pasty coloured one from Nokia. Instead, we chose red and black since they're colours that go easy on your eyes. 
Very similat to using dark mode on your personal devices. 

Rules:

• Don't eat yourself or touch the walls.

• You can retry as many times as you want, but you will start from level 0 again. 

• There are 10 levels in the game. If you beat the 10th level, then you win the game 🥳

• The more apples you eat, the longer the snake grows and the faster it moves! 💨


Good luck and enjoy our interpretation of this iconic game!
